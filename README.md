# CompiPy
> a contraction of Comparison Python

A library for comparing data. This library uses Pandas under the hood.
This is mostly so I can keep track of my own ideas. I'm fairly inexperienced with libraries and python at the time of writing so please keep that in mind.

### Usage
To use the function with the provided sample data follow the instructions below:
1. Run the __init__.py function first to create the csv files in the project directory `python -m CompiPy.__init__`
2. Then the compare_table file can be ran using the sample function data `python -m CompiPy.compare_table`
